# Inspecting values with Nix REPL

When working with Nix expressions, it might be useful to be able to inspect some values involved. In these cases, the Nix REPL can be pretty useful.

## Some specific REPL forms

When you open up a REPL, you can use `:?` to see the specific REPL forms, e.g.:

```bash
bash> nix repl

Welcome to Nix version 2.2. Type :? for help.

nix-repl> :?
The following commands are available:

  <expr>        Evaluate and print expression
  <x> = <expr>  Bind expression to variable
  :a <expr>     Add attributes from resulting set to scope
  :b <expr>     Build derivation
  :i <expr>     Build derivation, then install result into current profile
  :l <path>     Load Nix expression and add it to scope
  # ...
```

The top three entries will be most often useful for us.

### Evaluate

The first is the same as an expression evaluation:

```bash
nix-repl> 1
1
```

### Bind

The second is the same as a `let`-bind in an expression:

```bash
nix-repl> a = 1

nix-repl> a
1
```

This is equivalent to `let a = 1; in ...`, but the introduced variables will persist in the session.

### Add attributes to scope

The third is the same as a `with` in an expression:

```bash
nix-repl> :a { hello = "bye"; }
Added 1 variables.

nix-repl> hello
"bye"
```

This is the same as `with { hello = "bye"; }; hello`.

Chances are, you probably won't want to use this one often, as you may end up with a scope full of random identifiers you do not want to use. However, this can be useful at least when you are using builtins:

```bash
nix-repl> :a builtins
Added 101 variables.

nix-repl> attrNames { hello = 1; bye = 2; }
[ "bye" "hello" ]
```

## Using the REPL with `<nixpkgs>`

Using the REPL with nixpkgs is one of the most common usages of the REPL. From here, you can inspect what packages are available, specific packages' versions, and try launching a Nix Shell with these packages.

```bash

bash> nix repl '<nixpkgs>' # or `nix repl your-pinned-nixpkgs.nix`

Loading '<nixpkgs>'...
Added 10647 variables.
```

For the most part, what you will find most useful is being able to tab-complete, e.g.:

```bash
nix-repl> pk<TAB>
pk2cmd              pkgconfig           pkgsBuildTarget     pkgsStatic
pkcs11helper        pkgconfigUpstream   pkgsCross           pkgsTargetTarget
pkg-config          pkgs                pkgsHostHost        pkgsi686Linux
pkg-configUpstream  pkgsBuildBuild      pkgsHostTarget      pktgen
pkgconf             pkgsBuildHost       pkgsMusl
```

### Building derivations

```bash
nix-repl> :?
  # ...
  :b <expr>     Build derivation
  :t <expr>     Describe result of evaluation
  :u <expr>     Build derivation, then start nix-shell

nix-repl> :t pkgs.purescript
a set

nix-repl> :u pkgs.purescript
these paths will be fetched (5.57 MiB download, 43.87 MiB unpacked):
  /nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0
copying path '/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0' from 'https://cache.nixos.org'...

nix-shell> which purs
/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0/bin/purs

nix-shell> purs --version
0.13.0
```

We can also build derivations from here to produce the outPath.

```bash
nix-repl> pkgs.purescript.outPath
"/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0"

nix-repl> :b pkgs.purescript

this derivation produced the following outputs:
  out -> /nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0

bash> fd . /nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0
/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0/bin
/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0/bin/purs
/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0/etc
/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0/etc/bash_completion.d
/nix/store/vmwdvr9fcrbvnfdjfrrpb07z8gzbi1q7-purescript-0.13.0/etc/bash_completion.d/purs-completion.bash
```

If you find that you want to install these packages to your profile, you can use `:i` to do so. From `:?`:

```bash
nix-repl> :?
  # ...
  :b <expr>     Build derivation
  :i <expr>     Build derivation, then install result into current profile
  :l <path>     Load Nix expression and add it to scope
  :s <expr>     Build dependencies of derivation, then start nix-shell
  :u <expr>     Build derivation, then start nix-shell
```

## P.S.

I have not found a very useful way to use Nix repl to actually work with individual derivations. To explain, consider that we have some project with a `default.nix` derivation:

```bash
bash> nix repl default.nix

Loading 'default'...
Added 39 variables. # what variables were loaded? dunno!

nix-repl> src # useful!
# someresult, e.g. a derivation

nix-repl> outPath # also useful!
"/nix/store/somehash-somename"
```

Seems useful, but seemingly there is no way to build our top-level derivation, so we need to do this manually.

```bash
nix-repl> :b import ./default.nix {}

this derivation produced the following outputs:
  out -> /nix/store/somehash-somename
```

There may be more hidden elements to the REPL that I don't know about, but for the most part, the REPL is useful only really in looking at what attributes are inside of a given package set more than interactively working with derivations.
