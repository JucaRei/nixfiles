    # This dispatcher script makes Wi-Fi mutually exclusive with wired networking. When a wired
    # interface is connected, Wi-Fi will be set to airplane mode (rfkilled). When the wired
    # interface is disconnected, Wi-Fi will be turned back on. Name this script e.g.
    # 70-wifi-wired-exclusive.sh and put it into /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ directory.
    # See NetworkManager(8) manual page for more information about NetworkManager dispatcher
    # scripts.
